        <p>Oliver uses nature as springboard to the sacred - the beating heart of her work.</p>

        "Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's noval "<a href="#">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins 
        of Oliver's "<a href="#">New and Selected Poems, Volumn One</a>." A <br> struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, 
        with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the <br> long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that 
        he has been putting together. For solace adn inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Rocthke, <br> Sara Teasdale - before 
        discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They 're very simple. And yet each has <br>something."

        <li>I don't know exactly what a prayer is.</li>
        <li>I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down</li>
        <li>into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,</li>
        <li>how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,</li>
        <li>which is what I have been doing all day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The cadenes are almost Biblical. "Attention is the begining of devotion," she urges elsewhere.</p>
